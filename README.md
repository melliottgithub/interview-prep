# Data Structures, Algorithms, and System Design
This repository contains a collection of data structures, algorithms, and system design examples, implemented in various programming languages. The goal of this repository is to provide a resource for developers to learn and practice fundamental computer science concepts.

## Table of Contents
    - Data Structures and Algorithms
    - System Design

### Data Structures
This section contains implementations of various data structures, including:

    - Linked lists
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Trees
    - Hash tables
    - Graphs
    - etc

### Algorithms
Implementations of various algorithms, including:

    - Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort, etc.)
    - Searching algorithms (linear search, binary search, etc.)
    - Dynamic programming algorithms (Fibonacci sequence, shortest path, etc.)
    - Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.)
Each implementation includes a description of the algorithm, its time and space complexity, and example usage.

### System Design
This section contains examples of system design for various scenarios, including:

    - Designing a web application
